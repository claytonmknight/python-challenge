This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing financial data and election data.

## financial analysis

The financial analysis script (financial_analysis.py) analyzes budget data stored in a CSV file. It calculates various financial metrics, including the total number of months, total profits/losses, average change in profits/losses, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The analysis results are printed to the console and exported to a text file.

## election analysis

The election analysis script (election_analysis.py) analyzes election data stored in a CSV file. It calculates the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes each candidate received, and determines the winner of the election based on the popular vote. The analysis results are printed to the console and exported to a text file.
